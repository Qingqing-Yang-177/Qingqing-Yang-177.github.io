### About Me

Hi, I am Qingqing Yang, and I just graduated with an M.A. in Psychology from New York University this May 2023. Finally, I am receiving financial recognition for my research efforts now: 

<br>

  As an **Assistant Research Scientist** in the [**Clay Curtis lab**](https://www.clayspacelab.com/lab) at NYU, I'm running a TMS, fMRI, and eye-tracking integrated spatial working memory study, which focuses on the role of parietal cortex on resource allocation strategy. 

<br>

  I'm also a **Research Assistant** in the [**Cate Hartley lab**](https://www.hartleylab.org/) at NYU with Dr. Noam Goldway, investigating the relationship among decision-making (reinforcement learning parameters), developmental and psychiatric disorders, and neural factors.

### Research Interests

- **Model of Cognition and Perception:** working memory, attention, decision making
- **Computational Neuroscience:** Manifolds of neural activity, sensorimotor hierarchy
- **Applied Machine Learning:** reinforcement learning, artificial neural networks

I love computational modeling in general. Nowadays, advanced technologies influence the lives of everybody. Though concerns exist, technologies are supposed to augment efficiency instead of replacing humans in the workplace. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
