### About Me

Hi, I am Qingqing Yang, and I am a PhD student in Cogitive Neuroscience at the Ohio State University from Aug 2024, working with [Prof. Hsin-Hung Li](https://www.hsinhungli.com/) and [Prof. Julie Golomb](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/). `last update: Aug 2025`

### Research Interests

- **Cognition:** visual perception, memory, learning and decision making
- **Neural Imaging:** fMRI, dMRI, EEG, TMS

I love computational modeling in general. I question how metal computation is realized to perform complex functions among human and models, and how the deepened understanding of each aspect benefit each other.

### News

- **[Aug 2025]** Our [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=eYVFs6TfQ0) got accepted at NeurIPS 2025!
  We shows that after learning stimulus–reward associations, both humans and RNNs maintain higher-value information with greater stability in working memory, where We introduce a normative account with maximizing utility as the objective.

- **[May 2025]** I attended VSS 2025 to present a poster of working memory resource allocation project with preliminary behavioral results.

- **[Dec 2024]** I attended NeurIPS 2024 Unireps workshop to present our [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=t4CnKu6yXn) on how model modality and training objectives influence the transformers-brain alignment during visual perception.
