### About Me

Hi, I am Qingqing Yang, and I just started my PhD in Cogitive Neuroscience at the Ohio State University this Aug 2024, working with [Prof. Hsin-Hung Li](https://www.hsinhungli.com/) and [Prof. Julie Golomb](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/).

### Research Interests

- **Cognition:** visual perception, attention, memory, learning and decision making
- **Neural Imaging:** task-fMRI, rs-fMRI, dMRI, EEG, TMS
- **Computational Neuroscience:** neural geometry, neural dynamics
- **Applied Machine Learning:** reinforcement learning, ANNs, Bayesian Inferences, model interpretability

I love computational modeling in general. I question how metal computation is realized to perform complex functions among human and machines, and how the deepened understanding of each aspect benefit each other.
